iir_notch (MathScript RT Module Function)
Owning Class: singlerate 
Requires: Digital Filter Design Toolkit and MathScript RT Module
 
Syntax
[b, a] = iir_notch(w, bw) 
[b, a] = iir_notch(w, bw, ab) 

Legacy Name: iirnotch 
 
Description
Designs a second-order, infinite impulse response (IIR) notch filter. 

Inputs 
w - Specifies the center frequency of the filter notch. w is a double-precision, floating-point number that must fall in the range (0, 1). 
bw - Specifies the bandwidth of the filter notch at -ab dB. bw is a double-precision, floating-point number that must fall in the range (0, 1). 
ab - Specifies the attenuation, in decibels, that corresponds to the bandwidth bw. ab is a double-precision, floating-point number greater than zero. The default is 3.0103, which corresponds to a 3 dB bandwidth, a commonly used bandwidth for a filter. 

Outputs 
b - Returns the numerator of the designed IIR filter. b is a three-element real vector. 
a - Returns the denominator of the designed IIR filter. a is a three-element real vector. 

Examples
[B, A] = iir_notch(0.1, 0.001); 
fft_mag = abs(fft(B, 16384)./fft(A, 16384)); 
figure; 
plot(0:1/8192:1, fft_mag(1:8193));
