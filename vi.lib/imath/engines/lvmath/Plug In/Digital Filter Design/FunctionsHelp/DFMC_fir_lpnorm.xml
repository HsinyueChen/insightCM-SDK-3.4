fir_lpnorm (MathScript RT Module Function)
Owning Class: singlerate 
Requires: Digital Filter Design Toolkit and MathScript RT Module
 
Syntax
b = fir_lpnorm(n, f, e, mag) 
b = fir_lpnorm(n, f, e, mag, w) 
b = fir_lpnorm(n, f, e, mag, w, p) 
[b, err] = fir_lpnorm(n, f, e, mag) 
[b, err] = fir_lpnorm(n, f, e, mag, w) 
[b, err] = fir_lpnorm(n, f, e, mag, w, p) 

Legacy Name: firlpnorm 
 
Description
Designs a finite impulse response (FIR) filter that uses the least p-th norm algorithm to approximate the frequency response you specify. 

Inputs 
n - Specifies the order of the filter. n is a nonnegative integer. 
f - Specifies the frequency points. f is a vector whose values increase monotonically between 0 and 1. 
e - Specifies the band edge frequencies. e is a vector whose values must also exist in f. 
mag - Specifies the magnitude response of the filter at f. mag is a vector of the same length as f. 
w - Specifies the weight of each frequency point. w is a vector of the same length as f. The default is a vector in which each element has a value of 1. 
p - Specifies the value of p to use in the least p-th norm algorithm. p is a positive integer that must fall in the range [1, 128]. The default is 128. 

Outputs 
b - Returns the coefficients of the designed FIR filter. b is a real vector with a length of n+1. 
err - Returns the least p-th norm approximation error. err is a real number. 

Examples
B = fir_lpnorm(40, [0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]); 
fft_mag = abs(fft(B, 16384)); 
figure; 
plot(0:1/8192:1, fft_mag(1:8193)); 
 
B = fir_lpnorm(22, [0, 0.4, 0.6, 1], [0, 0.4, 0.6, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], 2); 
figure; 
freqzd(B); 
 
B = fir_lpnorm(22, [0, 0.4, 0.6, 1], [0, 0.4, 0.6, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], 4); 
figure; 
freqzd(B);
